# CetaceanFunction

Supplementary code for J.Oeke's dissertation for
MSc in Global Biodiversity Conservation with the title:  
**'Using cetacean functional parameters to identify marine areas in need of protection'**

Aim: To identify marine areas in need of protection in oder to preserve cetacean ecosystem functions.
This was done by classifying areas of low functional redundancy and high functional dispersion of cetaceans and
furthermore by determining the functional trade-off between dispersion and redundancy in marine ecoregions.

Repository contains:
- R code for determining species distribution (using aquamaps.org)
- R code for selecting and imputating traits data
- R code for performing the functional analysis

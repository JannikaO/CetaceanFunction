# CetaceanFunction

Supplementary code and results for J.Oeke's dissertation for
MSc in Global Biodiversity Conservation with the title:
'Using cetacean functional redundancy to identify marine areas in need of protection'

Aim: To identify marine areas in need of protection in oder to preserve cetacean ecosystem functions.
This was done by classifying areas of low functional redundancy and high functional dispersion of cetaceans and
furthermore by determining the functional trade-off between dispersion and redundancy in marine ecoregions.

Repository contains:
- R code for determining species distribution (using aquamaps.org), selecting and imputating traits data, and doing the functional analysis
- results from the trait selection, trait imputation and the functional analysis
